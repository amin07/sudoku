# suduko-implementation
Sudoko implementaion using Backtracking search and Heuristics in Java

Source code need to be compiled with java

Instructions:
1. Put the source files (Game.java) and data files(easy_tests.txt, medium_tests.txt, hard_tests.txt) in current directory
2. Compile Game.java with command : javac Game.java
	- it will create Game.class file (althoug gives some minor warning about casting)
3. Run the class file using command : java Game
4. It will provide a menu for choosing one of the test case files
5. It will provide another menu for choosing an algorithm
6. Once both are selected it will run and display the puzzle, running time and the solution grid

NOTE: For Simulated Annealing, solution could not be found for some runs. Beacuse, this algorithm is
random in nature, it will produce solution sometimes if one keeps running
